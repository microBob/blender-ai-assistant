The Bilingual (Blocked) Stroop - comparing Stroop interference effects across languages
================================================================================================================

The purpose of this demo is to illustrate how to make a blocked design in PsychoPy. The demo presents two blocks, an English block and a Maori block, group A will see English words first and group B will see Maori words first. 

The experiment: 
---------------------

Reading words in your native language is a very overlearned task, which is  difficult to suppress. Hence, when asked to report the color of a word in the classic Stroop task,the semantic context of the text can interfere with what should be a simple color judgement - i.e., the Stroop effect. The Stroop effect should be larger in the language in which one is most fluent, rather than a 
language in which one is familiar. This Bilingual (Blocked) Stroop can demonstrate this, running the classic Stroop task in the English and Maori language. In this task subjects must report the colour of the letters spelling each word, but letters themselves also spell a colour name and this may be the same or different to the colour of the letters. Words will be English or Maori, depending on the condition.

Analysing your data:
---------------------

After you run the study, look in the data/ folder next to where the 
experiment was saved. There will be an xlsx file there that can be opened
with Microsoft Excel or similar spreadsheet package. Each row represents
one condition (trial type) and each column is one variable of your experiment or type of data collected. Take the average of the resp.mean_rt column for the 3 congruent conditions  and compare them with the 3 incongruent conditions and compare this Stroop effect across languages. In most cases the incongruent conditions will have larger reactions times, and this effect will be larger for the fluent or native language compared with the familiar, non-native language.
